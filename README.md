# Predicting NFL Draft

The focus of this project is to discover the significant variables contributing to the probabilities of a college linebacker being drafted to the NFL. The data was scraped from the Pro Football Reference database and consists of every linebacker who participated in the NFL Combine from 2013 to 2022. 

Information regarding the process and findings can be found in the **NFL Draft Analysis Report**, which includes the *data acquistion process*, *feature selection*, and *final thoughts and interpretations*.
